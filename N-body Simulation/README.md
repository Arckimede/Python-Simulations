🌍N-Body Planetary Simulation

This project is a 2D gravitational simulation built in Python using Pygame. It models the Sun and several planets orbiting under Newtonian gravity. 
Planets are influenced by the Sun’s mass, initial velocities and the gravitational constant, producing realistic orbital paths. 
Some features: 
-Pre-loaded planets (Earth, Jupiter, Saturn) orbiting the sun🪐

-Add a planet interactively by clicking on the game🆕 

-Energy display (Kinetic, Potential, Total) updated in real-time📈 

-Starfield background for a space-like aesthetic⭐

-Grid overlay for spatial reference📐 

-Popups showing planet positions when hovering near them🎨

-Restart / Pause control using UI buttons▶️
