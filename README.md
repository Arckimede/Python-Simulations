# Python-Simulations

This repository contains a collection of interactive Python simulations. Each project demonstrates computational modeling, visualization, and object-oriented programming in Python. The simulations 
included here explore a variety of concepts, from gravitational dynamics to predator-prey ecosystems. 

🐺Wolves and Rabbits Simulation

This project is an ecosystem simulation built in Python using Pygame. It models interactions between wolves, rabbits, and grass in a 2D environment. Wolves hunt 🐇, rabbits eat 🌱 and both species reproduce and die based on their energy levels. The simulation shows how populations change dynamically over time depending on food availability, reproduction and survival.

🦠Virus Spread Simulation

This project is an agent-based virus simulation built with Python. It models the spread of a contagious disease in a closed environment where agents can become infected, recover, die or gain immunity. The simulation is interactive: you can adjust the infection probability with a slider while the simulation is running.

🎯3D Projectile Motion Simulation

This project is a 3D physics simulation built with VPython. It models the trajectory of a projectile under the influence of gravity and air drag, with real-time visualization. The user can interactively adjust the drag coefficient using a slider to observe how it affects the projectile’s flight.

🪐Saturn Rings Simulation

This project is a 3D orbital mechanics simulation. It models Saturn, a nearby moon and multiple particles representing Saturn’s rings. The simulation shows how the moon’s gravitational force perturbs the motion of particles in the rings.

🧪Molecular Dynamics Simulation

This project simulates the motion of molecules in a 2D box using Matplotlib and NumPy. Molecules move randomly, collide with each other and the walls and display velocity vectors and neighbor connections.

🌌Black Hole Accretion Simulation

This is a 3D black hole simulation using VPython, modeling an accretion disk with particles orbiting a black hole. Particles are drawn toward the black hole based on gravitational physics and disappear when they cross the event horizon.

🐦Boids Flocking Simulation

This is a real-time flocking simulation implemented in Python using Pygame. It models the behavior of a group of autonomous agents (boids) that move according to three simple rules:
-Separation: avoid crowding nearby boids.
-Alignment: match the velocity of neighboring boids.
-Cohesion: steer toward the average position of nearby boids.

🌀Double Pendulum Chaos Simulation

This project is a physics-based simulation of a double pendulum system implemented in Python using NumPy and Matplotlib. It numerically solves the coupled nonlinear differential equations governing the motion of two connected pendulums using a fourth-order Runge–Kutta (RK4) integrator. The simulation demonstrates chaotic dynamics: even tiny changes in initial conditions lead to drastically different trajectories over time. In addition to real-time animation, the project includes energy analysis to observe numerical stability and integration accuracy.

The project features:
-Numerical integration using RK4
-Full nonlinear equations of motion
-Real-time 2D animation
-Total energy computation and drift analysis
-Visualization of chaotic behavior
