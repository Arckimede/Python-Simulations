# Python-Simulations
A collection of Python simulations

This repository contains a collection of interactive Python simulations. Each project demonstrates computational modeling, visualization, and object-oriented programming in Python. The simulations 
included here explore a variety of concepts, from gravitational dynamics to predator-prey ecosystems. 

🐺Wolves and Rabbits Simulation

This project is an ecosystem simulation built in Python using Pygame. It models interactions between wolves, rabbits, and grass in a 2D environment. Wolves hunt 🐇, rabbits eat 🌱 and both species reproduce and die based on their energy levels. The simulation shows how populations change dynamically over time depending on food availability, reproduction and survival.
