# Python-Simulations

This repository contains a collection of interactive Python simulations. Each project demonstrates computational modeling, visualization and object-oriented programming in Python. The simulations  included here explore a variety of concepts, from gravitational dynamics to predator-prey ecosystems. 

🐺Wolves and Rabbits Simulation

This project is an ecosystem simulation built in Python using Pygame. It models interactions between wolves, rabbits and grass in a 2D environment. Wolves hunt rabbits, rabbits eat grass and both species reproduce and die based on their energy levels. The simulation shows how populations change dynamically over time depending on food availability, reproduction and survival.

🦠Virus Spread Simulation

This project is an agent-based virus simulation built with Python. It models the spread of a contagious disease in a closed environment where agents can become infected, recover, die or gain immunity. The simulation is interactive: you can adjust the infection probability with a slider while the simulation is running.

🎯3D Projectile Motion Simulation

This project is a 3D physics simulation built with VPython. It models the trajectory of a projectile under the influence of gravity and air drag, with real-time visualization. The user can interactively adjust the drag coefficient using a slider to observe how it affects the projectile’s flight.

🪐Saturn Rings Simulation

This project is a 3D orbital mechanics simulation. It models Saturn, a nearby moon and multiple particles representing Saturn’s rings. The simulation shows how the moon’s gravitational force perturbs the motion of particles in the rings.

🧪Molecular Dynamics Simulation

This project simulates the motion of molecules in a 2D box using Matplotlib and NumPy. Molecules move randomly, collide with each other and the walls, and display velocity vectors and neighbor connections.

🌌Black Hole Accretion Simulation

This is a 3D black hole simulation using VPython, modeling an accretion disk with particles orbiting a black hole. Particles are drawn toward the black hole based on gravitational physics and disappear when they cross the event horizon.

🐦Boids Flocking Simulation

This is a real-time flocking simulation implemented in Python using Pygame. It models the behavior of a group of autonomous agents (boids) that move according to three simple rules:

-Separation: avoid crowding nearby boids.

-Alignment: match the velocity of neighboring boids.

-Cohesion: steer toward the average position of nearby boids.

🌀Double Pendulum Chaos Simulation

This project is a physics-based simulation of a double pendulum system implemented in Python using NumPy and Matplotlib. It numerically solves the coupled nonlinear differential equations governing the motion of two connected pendulums using a fourth-order Runge–Kutta (RK4) integrator. The simulation demonstrates chaotic dynamics: even tiny changes in initial conditions lead to drastically different trajectories over time. In addition to real-time animation, the project includes energy analysis to observe numerical stability and integration accuracy.

The project features:

1. Numerical integration using RK4

2. Full nonlinear equations of motion

3. Real-time 2D animation

4. Total energy computation and drift analysis

5. Visualization of chaotic behavior

🚀 Orbital Transfer Simulator (Hohmann Transfer)

This project is a 2D orbital mechanics simulation built in Python using NumPy and Matplotlib. It models a spacecraft performing a Hohmann transfer between two circular Earth orbits using impulse-based velocity burns. The simulation numerically integrates the full two-body gravitational equations of motion using a fourth-order Runge–Kutta (RK4) method. 

The project features:

1. Full Newtonian two-body gravitational model

2. RK4 numerical integration

3. Impulse-based Δv maneuvers

4. Automatic apoapsis detection for second burn

5. Real-time trajectory visualization

6. Analytical Δv calculation and comparison
